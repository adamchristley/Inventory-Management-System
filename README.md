This C# project was developed for my MIS-2150 course (Programming II/C++). This course went over C++ and C# with the final being requested in C#, or C++ if not comfortable with C#. This project isn't entirely finished but completed everything required in the rubric and more with additional features I wanted to add while working on it. The final version of this project would have a completed system with a cash system and completed user and admin end functions with the typical day-to-day business needs.
